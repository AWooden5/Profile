Hello, My name is Armani Wooden. I am 23 years old and I am a senior computer technology major here at Bowie State University. I'm from Prince George's County and my years at bowie has been a blast. I enjoy working out, playing video games, eating food, and capturing moments that'll last a lifetime. Here's some of my work over the years I have been in school.
The chatbot was implemented using fundamental Python programming concepts to simulate interactive conversation. It operates within a continuous loop (`while True`) that prompts the user to ask questions related to skills, experience, projects, or contact information. User input is taken through the `input()` function and converted to lowercase to standardize responses and allow for simple keyword matching. The program then checks the input using a series of `if` and `elif` statements to identify specific keywords such as "skill", "experience", "project", or "phone". When a match is found, the chatbot responds with a predefined message relevant to that topic. If the input does not match any of the known categories, a default message is returned, letting the user know that the input was not understood. The chatbot also includes a condition to break the loop and end the session when the user types "quit". This basic chatbot design effectively simulates a FAQ-style assistant, allowing users to interactively learn more about the developerâ€™s background without needing advanced frameworks or external libraries, making it ideal for environments like CodeHS.
