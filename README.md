Hello, My name is Armani Wooden. I am 23 years old and I am a senior computer technology major here at Bowie State University. I'm from Prince George's County and my years at bowie has been a blast. I enjoy working out, playing video games, eating food, and capturing moments that'll last a lifetime. Here's some of my work over the years I have been in school.
